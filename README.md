# Threddit - Wardrobe performance

### Project
"Threddit" is my personal project attempting to build a proper understanding of the real cost and eventually environmental impact of my use of clothes. The data set is a continuous daily log of my use of each piece of garment since 1 January 2018. In addition to showing the real cost per wear and frequency of use for each garment, this enables studying the correlation between price and quality (as measured by durability), as well as actual vs imagined use. Visibility into item-level cost efficiency has been eye-opening in many ways. My main goal is not to drive down cost though, but to make better consumption choices especially from a sustainability perspective.

In order to be able to do the computing and visualisaion I wanted, I built this solution in R.

I publish my continously updated wardrobe performance on [hoverfalt.github.io](https://hoverfalt.github.io/).

For context and background, please see my blog post [Why I’ve tracked every single piece of clothing I’ve worn for three years](https://www.reaktor.com/blog/why-ive-tracked-every-single-piece-of-clothing-ive-worn-for-three-years/). 

### Contribute
I built this to be a tool for myself. Due to increasing interest, I'm thinking about how to best go about making something like this available for broader good. If you have ideas or would like to contibute, please feel free to reach out :)
